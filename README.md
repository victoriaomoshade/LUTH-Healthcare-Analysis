# 🏥 LUTH Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This project presents a healthcare data analytics solution designed to support **both executive decision-making and operational analysis** using the same dataset.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how data can be communicated differently depending on the audience — combining **high-level executive reporting** with **detailed analytical insights**.

The dataset represents patient records from a healthcare facility and was analyzed to uncover trends in admissions, diagnoses, revenue, and operational performance.
